Whether you're a beginner, mid-level, or advanced, you should know that contributing to GitHub projects, repositories are a good sign of your involvement and a some-sort-of proof that you're more eager to collaborate on projects in your work (or it'll become if you're searching for job)

You could also want to support me, if so — I am extremely grateful for it, and I will improve the content that I put on this blog — I promise!

When I was a beginner in Open-Source GitHub projects I wanted (and still want) to collaborate on projects, but didn't do it, because there wasn't enough guidance and I ended up creating my own projects, which can be quite chaotic to understand, so not every one of them is listed here, and I won't put them here until I finish basic documentation of it instead of simple ```README.md``` file.

Here I provide the projects that are ready for collaboration.

## [Awesome-Worldwide-ITSecurity-Specialists](https://github.com/Cloufish/Awesome-Worldwide-ITSecurity-Specialists)
- The repository for non-native English people, who also don't understand English proficient enough like native-speaker does.
- Also, for language learners wanting to have immersion content that wouldn't interfere with their passion of learning ITSec.
- Some might argue that it's an unnecessary repo, and it's inevitable to learn English. Yeah, in some way it is, but if someone doesn't know anything about Security, then I want them to have more smooth start :)

The contribution is really fast and easy. I advise you also to contribute to other 'Awesome' repos like that.
