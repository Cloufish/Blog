## #1 The Holy Grail - [AWESOME-HACKING](https://github.com/Hack-with-Github/Awesome-Hacking)
- Please do not get scared of this huge amount of content 'to learn'
- In reality, you **need** to just pick up the things that interest you and then keep learning them, without saying that you need to be perfect in everything.
- **Focus on one thing and do it right!**

### #2 [CAREER PATHWAY](https://www.cyberseek.org/pathway.html)
- This will help you with deciding what main path you choose.
- In my opinion, being determined and concentrated on **only** one thing at a time will lead you to success, because guess what - You'll eventually need to choose in this main path subcategories again. For example you can't be Penetration Tester for everything, you would need to focus on one segment e.g Active Directory, Windows Security

### #3 The whole [github](https://github.com/)
- Googling stuff is important, but most of the stuff that I've got is from github repositories that are overflowed with Penetration Testing tools, BugBountyTips, Penetration Testing Tips, Report Templates, Old Penetration Testing Reports.
- And you'll find out soon enough that you need to create your own github repositories/contribute to them - to share your knowledge

### #4 Join Discord Communities
- When you'll run into problems that cannot be solved with google, or you want to find a mentor, then joining a Discord Penetration Testing/IT Security servers is ideal option for you

### #5 Places to practice Hacking:
- [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/dashboard) - This one is for beginners
- [HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.eu/) - This is for intermiediate beginner level(?).
- Many of other Vulnerable Applications like [DVWA](https://github.com/digininja/DVWA), [Juice Shop](https://github.com/bkimminich/juice-shop)


### Important notes
- But remember what I said earlier, you need to concentrate on one segment of Penetration Testing. Always think at the end of the day way what you need to improve and then just keep doing it. Don't let your mind distract you saying ```I need to learn programming, I'm not enough``` Because you can't focus on learning before doing the actual thing! This won't lead you far, and you'll be an 'eternal student' 

- Taking notes, revisioning them with Anki is a good thing to do, if you're thinking that it's a waste of time, then think again if the topic you're learning is relevant for you because you want to revision and remember things that you'll need quite often, right?
