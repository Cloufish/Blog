Hi there, I'm Barholomew. I'm 19 years old currently and I'm super  interested in automation, linux and Application Security.

I concentrate on Mobile and Web Applications, want to get better in Bug Bounty and in DevSecOps - training many programmers to be more concious about security of their code.

I myself really like programming in python, bash, and now I'm getting more intrested in [nim programming language](https://nim-lang.org/)

In my free-time I love singing, playing guitar and learning a language - currently Estonian. I keep telling myself that these hobbies will be profitable for me in future IT job, though It's probably not 100% true :D.

I'm a 'productivity' freak, but believe me, what I'm saying about it doesn't always match up with the reality of procrastination ;P
